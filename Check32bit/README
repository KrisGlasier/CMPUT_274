PLEASE VIEW ON ATOM EDITOR AND COMPILE AND UPLOAD VIA
    THE UBUNTU CMD WHEN IN RESPECTIVE FOLDER (COMMAND: MAKE UPLOAD)

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
    [0] USER DESIRES OUTPUT FROM 1 TO 32 BIT INTEGARS.
    [1] USER DESIRES TO RUN MULTIPLE TIMES

ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY. ALSO DESCRIBED IN THE PROGRAM FILE.
-------------------------------------------------------------
    [0] ONCE FINISHED, THERE IS A 5 SECOND DELAY TO SEE OUTPUT, AND THEN
        FUNCTION RETURNS TO MAIN MENU TO TEST AGAIN.
    [1] IF USER HAS INCORRECT INPUT, FUNCTION RETURNS WITH A MESSAGE INDICATING
        AN ERRER AND RETURNS TO THE MAIN MENU TO TRY AGAIN.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS WITH THE EXERCISE
----------------------------------------
  PROBLEMS
  --------
    [0] LINE 40. WHEN RETURNING TO MAIN MENU, SOME VARIABLES WOULD KEEP
        THEIR ORIGINAL VALUE AND NOT RESET. FIXED BY RE-INITIATING THEM
        IN THE MAIN OF THE FUNCTION.
    [1] LINE 62. HAD TROUBLE MAKING BITWISE OR WORK IN IF STAEMENTS
        FOR CAPITAL OR LOWERCASE LETTERS TO WORK. FIXED BY ADDING IN AN
        ERROR FUNCTION DECLARING POSSIBLE ERRORS.
    [2] LINE 107. HAD TROUBLE MAKING THE FUNCTION SHOW ALL BINARY FOR
        VALUE AND RELAY BACK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT. FIXED BY JUST
        FINDING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT VIA DIVISION.
    [3] LINE 163. STRUGGLED WITH LOGICAL AND TO FINISH MASKING THE OCTETS.
        FIXED BY SHIFTING ONE DIRECTION AND ANOTHER- SOLUTION ONLY WORKS
        ASSUMING ALL DESIRED BITS ARE IN A CONSECUTIVE STRING, NOT
        SEPERATED BY ANY ZEROES.
    [4] 200 LINES! ANY QUICK TIPS FOR CONDENSING MY CODE MORE? I DO HAVE
        UPWARDS OF 60 BLANK/COMMENT LINES, TOO BUT IT DOES HELP WITH
        READABILITY.
        
  QUESTIONS
  ---------
    [0] IS THERE A WAY TO GET ATOM OT AUTO-FOLD A SPECIFIC THING? FOR
        EXAMPLE, IF A PROGRAMMER WISHED TO FOLD THE WHILE LOOPS AT LINES
        125 AND 143, HOW WOULD THAT BE ACHEIVABLE?
    [1] HOW DOES ONE EFFICENTLY MASK BINARY WITH BITWISE FUNCTIONS?
    [2] WOULD YOU ADVISE A DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE ERROR MESSAGE
        AND WHEN TO REDIRECT TO MAIN MENU?

NO CODE DIRECTLY COPIED.
