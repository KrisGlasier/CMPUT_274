This repository has many of the files given in my CMPUT 274, Introduction to 
Tangible Computing I. Not every file was uploaded as they weren't documented at
all or were even simpler versions of the same files. Many files require
the context given, which I did not record in this class.

Not all of the code is mine, such as the makefiles and many of the functions as
our tasks were to complete or edit code given. 

Class: CMPUT 274, "Introduction to Tangible Computing I" from University of Alberta.
