This repository has many of the files given in my CMPUT 274, Introduction to Tangible Computing I.
Not every file was uploaded as they weren't documented at all or were even simpler versions
of the same files. In addition some functions and files may not be mine (such as the makefiles)
and I unfortunately don't remember which were other than the makefiles.

Class from University of Alberta.
